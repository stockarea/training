    <h1>About Us </h1>
    <p>
    	Classical server-side Web programs suffer from a large limitation: A Web server handles each Web request individually, without the context of other requests coming from the same user. This is a major limitation in situations such as sites that require users to log in and others where the user builds a shopping cart of desired items to buy. Such problems require that a server-side script remember what happened with previous requests, which can become a fairly complicated process as a Web server interleaves servicing requests from a variety of users.
